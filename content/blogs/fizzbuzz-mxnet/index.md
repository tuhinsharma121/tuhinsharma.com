<h2>Description</h2>

FizzBuzz problem was made popular by Joel Grus' [post](https://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) on tensorflow. This article shows how to model fizzbuzz using MXNet. This article shows how to use the basic building blocks of MXNet (autograd etc.) to build a network from scratch. It then goes to show how to use higher level APIs in MXNet to achieve the same.
