<h2>Description</h2>

According to one embodiment, a method, computer system, and computer program product for cognitively adjusting a notification alert delivery time are provided. The embodiment may include receiving a message notification from a sender. The embodiment may also include determining an importance of the received message notification based on a plurality of notification attributes and a plurality of person attributes that are each associated with the received message notification. The embodiment may further include, in response to determining to alert a user of the received message notification based on the determined importance, identifying a current user sleep stage. The embodiment may also include, in response to determining the current user sleep stage will minimally impact the user, transmitting the received message notification to a user device
