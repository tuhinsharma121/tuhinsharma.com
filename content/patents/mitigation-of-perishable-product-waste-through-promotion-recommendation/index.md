<h2>Description</h2>

The present invention relates generally to the field of computer data modeling, and more particularly to model generation of the effects of external events on consumer-packaged goods.

Perishable items are often put on clearance sale when it nears expiry date in order to clear inventory, maximize profits, or minimize loss of product. Typically, products are discarded if not sold be the expiration date. Promotions, such as putting items on “sale” or “clearance,” are used to avoid having to discard the expired items. It may be advantageous to determine an optimal promotion time frame or window to maximize profits and minimize waste.
